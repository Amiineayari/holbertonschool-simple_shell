	<h1>Simple Shell Project README</h1>
	<p>This project is a simple implementation of a shell, which is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with their computer system by executing commands.</p>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository:</p>
<code>git clone https://github.com/Amiineayari/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git</code>

<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>To compile the program, run the following command:</p>
<code>gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh</code>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use the shell, run the following command:</p>
<code>./hsh</code>
<p>Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just as you would in a regular terminal. The shell supports many of the standard commands, as well as some custom commands specific to this implementation.</p>
